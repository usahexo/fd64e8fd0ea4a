# How does keno work?

Keno is a very simple game to learn and play. The aim of the game is to match as many numbers as possible with those that are drawn out by the casino operator. The more numbers you match, the bigger your payout will be.

To play keno, you first need to decide how much money you want to wager on the game. You can then choose between one and twenty numbers on your ticket. If you don’t want to pick any numbers yourself, you can opt for a random ticket instead. Once you have done this, simply wait for the draw to take place and see if any of your chosen numbers match those that are drawn. If they do, congratulations – you have just won!

If none of your chosen numbers match those that are drawn out, don’t worry – there’s still a chance that you could win by matching bonus balls. These are randomly selected numbers which offer smaller payouts but can still result in some big wins if you hit them!

# What bets can I make?

There are a variety of different bets that you can make when playing keno. Here are just a few of the most popular ones:

Straight bet: This is where you bet on a single number or set of numbers and try to match them with those that are drawn out by the casino operator. If successful, your payout will be based on how many numbers you matched multiplied by your original stake amount .
