#  How To Make A gambling web server casino poker 

In this article, we are going to show you how to make your own gambling web server. For this tutorial, we will be using the casino poker game.

To start off, we need to create a new folder and name it whatever you want your server to be called. Inside of this folder, create a file called “config.json” and add the following content:

Next, we need to install Node.js. You can find instructions on how to do that on the Node.js website. Once Node.js is installed, open up a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder containing your server files. Then type the following command to install the required packages:

npm install --save casino-poker

This will install the casino-poker package, which is what we will be using for our game.

Now that all of the packages are installed, we can start writing the code for our server. Open up a new file called “server.js” and add the following code:

The first thing we need to do is create an instance of the CasinoPoker object and pass in our configuration data that we defined in our config file earlier. Next, we need to set up a route that will handle requests for the /game path. This route will use the get method to request data from our CasinoPoker object and then print it out to the console.

Next, we need to set up a route that will handle requests for the /rank path. This route will use the get method to request data from our CasinoPoker object and then print it out to the console.

Finally, we need to set up a route that will handle requests for the /timeout path. This route will use the get method to request data from our CasinoPoker object and then print it out to the console

This document will guide you through the entire process of setting up your own gambling web server casino poker.

1. Firstly, you will need to decide on which software to use for your server. There are a few options available, but we recommend using Apache, MariaDB and PHP (AMP).

2. Once you have decided on the software, you will need to download and install it onto your server. Be sure to follow the instructions specific to your chosen software.

3. Next, you will need to configure your server settings. This will vary depending on the software you are using, but will generally include specifying a domain name and FTP details.

4. Now that your server is set up, you will need to create a database and user account for your casino site. Be sure to keep the username and password safe – you will need them later!

5. The next step is to set up your website files. This can be done easily by uploading them via FTP or through cPanel’s File Manager feature.

6. Once your website files are uploaded, you will need to configure them so that they work with your gambling software. This includes setting up a MySQL database connection and specifying the location of your Apache document root folder. For more information on this, be sure to check out the software’s documentation or our own tutorials on casino setup (see below).

7. Finally, test your website! You can do this by loading it in a web browser on any computer or mobile device connected to the internet. If everything is working correctly, you should see the casino lobby page with all of the games available for play.

This document will guide you through the steps necessary to start a gambling web server.



## Prerequisites

Before you can start a gambling server, there are a few things you'll need:

* A computer with an internet connection
* A domain name and web hosting (or VPS) account
* Some money to gamble with (optional)


## Setting up the server

Once you have all of the prerequisite items, setting up the server is fairly easy:
1. Set up your web hosting account or VPS. This document will assume you're using a web host. If you're using a VPS, some of the instructions may not apply (e.g. installing Apache).
2. Download and install Apache 2.4 or later. You can find installation instructions on the Apache website . 
3. Download and install PHP 5.6 or later. You can find installation instructions on the PHP website . 
4. Download and install Mysql 5.6 or later. You can find installation instructions on the Mysql website . 
5. Once you have all of the above installed, create a new folder on your computer called "gambling-server" 
6. Navigate to the gambling-server folder in a terminal window and run the following command: `sudo php -S localhost:8000` This will start Apache and PHP on your server and make them available at http://localhost:8000/.  7. Point your domain name to your web host's IP address (or VPS) by editing your domain's DNS settings . This document will assume your domain is example.com . 8. Congratulations! Your gambling web server is now set up and ready to use!

#  How to create a gambling web server casino poker

In this tutorial we will create a web server casino poker. The steps are as follows:

First, we need to install Apache2, PHP and MySQL. To do this open a terminal window and type the following commands:

sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apache2 php7.0 mysql-server

Now we need to create a database for our casino. To do this we will use the MySQL command line interface. Open a terminal window and type the following command:

mysql -u root -p

Enter your MySQL root password when prompted. Then type the following command to create a new database called "casino":

CREATE DATABASE casino;

Now we need to create a user for our casino database. To do this, type the following command:

GRANT ALL ON casino.* TO 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Where "user" is the username you want to use and "password" is the password you want to use. Now we need to import some data into our casino database. You can get this data from here: https://github.com/gabrielbarretto/web-server-casino-poker/archive/master.zip . Download the file and extract it somewhere on your computer. Then open a terminal window and type the following commands:


cd master mysql -u user -p casinodb < data_mysql.sql

#  How to make a gambling web server casino poker site

This document will teach you how to set up a gambling web server. You will need:

- A web server (e.g. Apache, Nginx)
- PHP 5.x+ with CURL support
- MySQL
- An SSL certificate (optional)

1. Set up your web server
If you haven't already, set up your web server according to the instructions for your platform. For example, if you're using Apache, see: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/installation/linux.html#wpmu
2. Install PHP and MySQL
If you haven't already, install PHP and MySQL on your web server according to the instructions for your platform. For example, if you're using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-php-7-0-and-mysql-5-7-on-ubuntu-16-04 
3. Download and configure Gambling Web Server casino poker site software
Download the latest release of Gambling Web Server casino poker site software from http://gwsprod.com/. Unzip the downloaded file and rename the folder to "gws". Copy the "gws" folder to your web server's document root (e.g. /var/www/). 
Open the "configure_gws" file in a text editor (e.g. vi, emacs) and edit the following settings:


	 	 	Database Type: mysql

	Hostname: localhost

	Database Name: gws

	Table Prefix: gws_

	Secret Key: This is a secret key that you must create; make sure it is kept secret!

	Change this value to match your own secret key

	ession_id: This is required for tracking player sessions

	Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): Enable this setting if you have an SSL certificate installed on your web server

 Save the file and close it.<br> If you are not comfortable editing configuration files by hand, use our online configuration tool at https://configure_gws_online.appspot.com/. This tool will walk you through the same steps as the "configure_gws" file but will do all the editing for you.<br> Note that if you use our online configuration tool, your secret key will be encrypted using HTTPS when it is stored on our servers.

4."index.php" file modifications<br> The "index.php" file located in the "gws" folder needs to be modified to work with Gambling Web Server casino poker site software.<br> Find the section of code that looks like this:<br><pre class="brush: php; title: ; lang=php"> $db = new mysqli($hostname, $username, $password, $database);</pre><br> Replace it with this code instead:<pre class="brush: php; title: ; lang=php"> $db = new PDO("mysql:[database]","[username]","[password]");</pre><br> Be sure to replace "[database]" with your actual database name, "[username]" with your actual username, and "[password]" with your actual password.<br> If don't want to use PDO or don't want to hardcode credentials into your code, see our documentation on authentication options at https://gwsprod1com/documentation/#authentication_options
5a."players table" creation<br> The "players" table needs to be created in order for Gambling Web Server casino poker site software to track players' sessions.<br> Use a SQL command like this one to create the table:<pre class="brushlang sql; title=; lang=sql"> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `players` ( `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `name` varchar(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', `email` varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', `ip` varchar(15) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' UNIQUE KEY `ip` (`ip`), PRIMARY KEY (`id`), INDEX `name` (`name` ASC)) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;</pre><br> Be sure to change "auto_increment" value depending on how many players you want to store in table.<br /> See our documentation on player sessions at https://gwsprod1com/documentation/#session_tracking for more information about how player sessions are tracked.</pre><h2 id="setting-up
