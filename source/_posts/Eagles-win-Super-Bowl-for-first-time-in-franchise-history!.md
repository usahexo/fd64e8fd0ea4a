#  Eagles win Super Bowl for first time in franchise history!

Philadelphia Eagles win Super Bowl LII in a thrilling 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots. This is the Eagles’ first championship in franchise history.

Quarterback Nick Foles was named MVP after throwing three touchdown passes and catching another one. Tight end Zach Ertz was also key for the Eagles, scoring two touchdowns. The Patriots were led by quarterback Tom Brady, who threw for 505 yards and three touchdowns.

The Eagles got off to a hot start, scoring on their opening drive. They added another touchdown in the second quarter to take a 14-3 lead into halftime. But the Patriots came roaring back in the second half, scoring 25 points to take a 33-32 lead with just over two minutes remaining.

The Eagles then drove down the field and scored the winning touchdown on a pass from Foles to Ertz. This was a stunning upset victory for Philadelphia, who were underdogs going into the game.

#  Nick Foles becomes first QB in NFL history to throw for 7 touchdowns in single game!

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for seven touchdowns in a single game. The Eagles defeated the Oakland Raiders 58-20 on Sunday.

Foles completed 22-of-28 passes for 406 yards and tied an NFL record with seven touchdown passes without an interception. He also had a rushing touchdown.

"It's surreal," Foles said. "It's something you dream of as a kid."

The performance was even more impressive given that the Eagles were missing their starting wide receivers, Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor. Tight end Zach Ertz led all receivers with eight receptions for 159 yards and three touchdowns.

"I have so much trust in Nick," Ertz said. "He's unbelievable."

The Eagles (9-1) have now won nine consecutive games and appear poised to make a deep playoff run.

#  Eagles make NFL history, become first team to ever win a Super Bowl with a backup quarterback!

It was a moment that will go down in NFL history. The Philadelphia Eagles, led by backup quarterback Nick Foles, won their first-ever Super Bowl title on Sunday night, beating the defending champion New England Patriots 41-33.

This was a team that was considered to be a long shot to make it to the Super Bowl prior to the start of the season, but they proved all the doubters wrong with an impressive run that culminated in a victory over the mighty Patriots.

Foles, who was thrust into the starting role after Carson Wentz sustained a season-ending injury late in the year, was unstoppable against New England’s vaunted defense. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards and three touchdowns, earning MVP honors in the process.

This was an Eagles team that was characterized by its grit and resilience; they never gave up, even when things looked bleakest. And that perseverance paid off on Sunday night, as they finally tasted championship glory.

The Philadelphia Eagles are now champions of the world!
