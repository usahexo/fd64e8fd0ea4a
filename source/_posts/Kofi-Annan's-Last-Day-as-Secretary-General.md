On October 14, 2001 – less than a month after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., – Annan issued a statement calling for "a world where human rights are at the core of every decision we make." The following year, he launched The Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve eight goals – including halving extreme poverty and halting the spread of HIV/AIDS – by 2015.
