# Turkmenistan Tax Officials Ensure That Gambling Winnings Are Fully Declared 

Turkmenistan tax officials are ensuring that all gambling winnings are properly declared and taxed.

The gambling industry has been thriving in Turkmenistan in recent years, with many people enjoying a flutter at the country's casinos and betting shops. However, as with any form of gambling, there is always the potential for people to win big money, and this has led to questions about how such winnings should be taxed.

Turkmenistan's tax authorities have now stepped in to make it clear that all gambling winnings must be declared and taxed in the same way as any other source of income. This means that anyone who wins a large amount of money from gambling will have to pay taxes on the full amount, regardless of whether they intend to keep it or not.

This move by the tax authorities is likely to be welcomed by most people in Turkmenistan, as it ensures that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. It also helps to ensure that the gambling industry is operated fairly and in a responsible manner.

# No Let Up In Turkmenistan Gambling Tax Revenue 

Turkmenistan’s gambling industry is booming, and tax revenue from the sector is on the rise. Gambling businesses in Turkmenistan paid US$22 million in taxes in 2016, up from US$16 million in 2015, according to the state news agency TDH.

The government has been keen to promote the development of the gambling industry as a way to boost its coffers. President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov issued a decree in December 2016 establishing a special commission to develop and regulate the gambling sector.

The main drivers of the growth in gambling revenue are casinos and horse racing. There are now 14 casinos operating in Turkmenistan, up from just four a few years ago. The number of race courses has also increased, with six now operational compared to just one in 2013.

The bulk of the gambling revenue is generated by foreigners. In 2016, foreigners accounted for 73 percent of casino revenue and 88 percent of horse racing bets. This is largely due to the fact that there are relatively few legal opportunities for locals to gamble.

The government appears intent on continuing to reap the benefits of the gambling boom. The special commission set up by President Berdimuhamedov is due to submit proposals this month on how to further develop the sector.

# Turkmenistan Continues To Crack Down On Illegal Gambling Activity 

Turkmenistan is continuing its crackdown on gambling activity, with authorities carrying out raids on a number of illegal casinos in the country.

In late December, police raided a number of casinos in the city of Turkmenbashi, arresting dozens of people and confiscating gaming equipment and cash. This is just the latest in a series of crackdowns on gambling in the country, with authorities having conducted similar raids in other cities throughout 2018.

The crackdown on gambling comes as part of Turkmenistan’s efforts to combat corruption and improve law and order. The government has stated that it views gambling as a major Problem, noting that it can lead to financial instability, crime and social problems.

As a result, the government has been working to shut down all forms of illegal gambling in the country. This has included shutting down unauthorized casinos and slot machines, as well as banning online gambling.

The crackdown on gambling is not without controversy, however. Some observers have criticized the government for going too far in its efforts to clamp down on the activity, arguing that it could lead to increased corruption and black market activity.

# Online Sports Betting Operators Advise Customers On How To Report Gambling Winnings

Online gambling operators are offering advice to customers on how to report any gambling winnings to the relevant tax authorities.

Most online gaming and sports betting companies are registered with the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), and as such, they have a legal obligation to report any gambling winnings over £10,000 (approximately $13,000) to the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs).

Customers who have won more than this amount are advised to contact the HMRC directly and provide them with their name, date of birth, address, and National Insurance number. They will also need to specify the amount of their winnings and the name of the online casino or betting company where they made the bet.

The HMRC will then issue a unique reference number that customers will need to quote when they come to pay their taxes.

For smaller amounts, customers can simply keep a record of their betting activity and any winnings in order to provide this information to the HMRC when required.

Gambling winnings are subject to income tax at a rate of 20%, although there may be some exemptions for professional gamblers. In addition, there is also a 5% Withholding Tax that online gaming operators are obliged to apply on all gambling winnings paid out to non-UK residents. This tax is designed to help offset some of the revenue lost by the British government from unlicensed offshore operators.

It is important for customers to be aware of these taxes before they start gambling, as they could end up paying a considerable amount in taxes on their winnings if they are not careful.
