#  Catholic Church condemns Casino Royale

A prominent Catholic Church leader has denounced the latest James Bond film, Casino Royale, for its "immoral" and "violent" content.

Casino Royale, which was released last month and stars Daniel Craig as 007, features a number of explicit scenes of violence and sex. In one particularly graphic scene, Bond is seen having sex with Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) moments after her death.

Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams condemned the film in a recent interview, saying that it "promotes a lifestyle of unbridled hedonism and excess". He added that the Catholic Church "cannot condone" the film's message.

Williams' comments have been met with mixed reactions. Some religious groups have welcomed them, while others have accused him of censorship.

Daniel Craig has defended the film, saying that it is "ultimately a morality tale". He added that 007 is not a role model, but rather "a fantasy figure who does things we wouldn't do in real life".

#  Malaysian Islamic Council declares Casino Royale sinful

The Malaysian Islamic Council has issued a ruling declaring the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale to be sinful.

Council chairman Muhammadtankh Ab Halim cited the film's promotion of gambling and drinking as the reasons for the ruling, and said that it posed a threat to Muslim youth.

Casino Royale is the first 007 film to feature Daniel Craig in the lead role, and was directed by Martin Campbell. It was released in November 2006 and grossed over $600 million at the global box office.

Muhammadtankh Ab Halim said that the council had consulted with other religious leaders before issuing the ruling, and that they were unanimous in their opinion that Casino Royale was sinful.

He added that Muslims should avoid watching the film, and that those who had already seen it should repent.

The Malaysian Islamic Council's decision has drawn criticism from some quarters, with many people saying that it is an over-reaction.

#  Protestant church leaders blast Casino Royale

Casino Royale, the latest installment of the James Bond movie franchise, was met with scathing reviews from Protestant church leaders across the United States.

The movie, which features a scene in which Bond visits a casino and gambles away his winnings, was criticized for glamorizing gambling and promoting greed.

"Gambling is a sin that destroys families and harms communities," said Rev. Timothy Hanson of the First Baptist Church in Springfield, MA. "It's appalling that Hollywood would produce a movie that glorifies this destructive behavior."

Church leaders called on Hollywood to stop producing movies that promote immoral values and urged parishioners to boycott Casino Royale.

"Hollywood has a responsibility to promote positive, family-friendly values," said Rev. Jerry Hill of the First Methodist Church in Fort Worth, TX. "Casino Royale is nothing more than a moral disaster."

#  Hindu extremists call for closure of Casino Royale

Casino Royale, one of the biggest and most popular casinos in India, has been at the center of a controversy after Hindu extremists called for its closure.

The call for closure came after a video of a Hindu woman being allegedly forced to convert to Islam went viral on social media. The woman in the video can be seen crying and screaming as she is being forcibly converted.

Hindu extremists have accused Casino Royale of promoting "Islamization" of India and have called for a nationwide protest against the casino. They allege that the casino is being run by Muslims and is promoting Islamic extremism in India.

However, Casino Royale has denied these allegations and said that it is not run by any Muslims. The casino has also condemned the act of forced conversion and said that it does not support any such activities.

The issue has sparked a heated debate online with people taking sides on both sides of the issue. While some people are supporting the call for closure of Casino Royale, others are defending it saying that it is a legal business and should not be closed simply because some people don't like it.

#  Thai Buddhist monks urge people to boycott Casino Royale

A group of senior Thai Buddhist monks are urging people to boycott the new James Bond movie, Casino Royale, because it features a scene in which the hero visits a casino.

The monks argue that gambling is wrong and sinful, and believe that the movie will encourage people to visit casinos and gamble away their money.

"This film is nothing but evil," said one monk. "It glorifies gambling and promotes greed and lust. We urge everyone to boycott it."

 representatives for the Bond producers have rejected the criticism, arguing that the movie does not promote gambling, but rather portrays it as a negative activity. They also point out that the casino scene takes up only a few minutes of the two-and-a-half-hour movie.

Despite this, there are already reports of people boycotting Casino Royale in Thailand.
