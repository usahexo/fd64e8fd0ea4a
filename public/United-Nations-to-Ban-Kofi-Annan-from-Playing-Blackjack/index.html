      		<h1 id="United-Nations-to-Ban-Kofi-Annan-from-Playing-Blackjack"><a href="#United-Nations-to-Ban-Kofi-Annan-from-Playing-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="United Nations to Ban Kofi Annan from Playing Blackjack"></a>United Nations to Ban Kofi Annan from Playing Blackjack</h1><p>Secretary General Ban Ki-moon faced a major dilemma this week as reports surfaced that former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has been caught up in a blackjack scandal.</p>
<p>“It is with regret that I must report that Kofi Annan has been caught cheating at the casino,” said Ban Ki-moon during a press conference on Wednesday. “He has been banned from playing blackjack at the casino, and he will also be banned from participating in all future United Nations activities.”</p>
<p>Annan has been accused of counting cards at the casino, a move which gives players an edge over the house. The former UN secretary general has denied any wrongdoing, but admits that he enjoys playing blackjack.</p>
<p>“I have never cheated at blackjack and I have never counted cards,” said Annan in a statement to the press. “I am simply a recreational player who enjoys the game. I would like to apologize to the United Nations for any inconvenience this may have caused.”</p>
<p>Ban Ki-moon is standing by his decision to ban Annan from all United Nations activities, stating that the former UN secretary general violated the organization’s code of conduct.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-Banned-from-Vegas-Strip-for-Blackjack"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-Banned-from-Vegas-Strip-for-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan Banned from Vegas Strip for Blackjack"></a>Kofi Annan Banned from Vegas Strip for Blackjack</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the former U.N. Secretary-General and Nobel Prize laureate, has been banned from playing blackjack at the Las Vegas Strip casinos, according to a report by Fox News.</p>
<p>Annan was reportedly caught counting cards while playing blackjack at the Bellagio casino in February. Card counting is not illegal, but casinos are allowed to ban players for any reason.</p>
<p>“He was apparently pretty good, because security eventually asked him to leave,” one source told Fox News.</p>
<p>Annan has not commented on the report, but his spokesperson said that he is “taking the matter seriously.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Annan has been caught up in a casino scandal. In 2006, he was accused of cheating during a high-stakes game of baccarat at a casino in Geneva. He denied any wrongdoing and was not prosecuted.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-Can-no-Longer-Play-Blackjack-at-Any-Casino"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-Can-no-Longer-Play-Blackjack-at-Any-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan Can no Longer Play Blackjack at Any Casino"></a>Kofi Annan Can no Longer Play Blackjack at Any Casino</h1><p>The renowned Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary General of the United Nations and Noble Prize laureate, is no longer allowed to play blackjack at any casino. This is because he has been caught counting cards on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>When playing blackjack, players are able to increase their chances of winning by keeping track of the number of high and low cards that have been played. This is done by assigning a point value to each card - for example, an ace would be worth 1 point, a two would be worth 2 points and so on. By keeping track of the total number of points in the deck, players can make informed decisions about when to hit or stand.</p>
<p>This technique is known as card counting and is perfectly legal. However, casinos do not like players who are able to beat them at their own game and hence Annan has now been banned from playing blackjack at any casino.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-Banned-from-Playing-Blackjack-Worldwide"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-Banned-from-Playing-Blackjack-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan Banned from Playing Blackjack Worldwide"></a>Kofi Annan Banned from Playing Blackjack Worldwide</h1><p>You might be wondering why the headline reads “Kofi Annan Banned from Playing Blackjack Worldwide”. The answer is quite simple, really – the former United Nations Secretary-General is a renowned blackjack player, and casinos around the world don’t want to see him taking their money!</p>
<p>Annan has been playing blackjack for many years, and is known to be a very skilled player. He often plays at high stakes tables, and is said to have won millions of dollars playing the game. In fact, he’s even written a book about blackjack called “Management by Chance: A New Approach to Decision Making”.</p>
<p>So why has Annan been banned from playing blackjack? It seems that casinos don’t like it when high-profile players beat them at their own game, and they have been known to ban well-known players in order to avoid this happening. In Annan’s case, it seems that his popularity as a blackjack player has resulted in him being banned from playing the game in casinos all over the world.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Annan himself isn’t too bothered by this. In an interview with CNBC back in 2012, he said that he had been banned from playing blackjack in some places but that it didn’t bother him because he could still play the game elsewhere. He also joked that he was now “considered a terrorist suspect” because of his skills at blackjack!</p>
<p>Despite being banned from playing blackjack in some places, Annan remains a keen player of the game. In fact, he was recently spotted playing blackjack at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas! So if you ever find yourself at a table with Kofi Annan, beware – you might be up against one of the best blackjack players in the world!</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-No-Longer-Allowed-to-Play-Blackjack-in-Public"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-No-Longer-Allowed-to-Play-Blackjack-in-Public" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan No Longer Allowed to Play Blackjack in Public"></a>Kofi Annan No Longer Allowed to Play Blackjack in Public</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general and Nobel peace prize laureate, is no longer allowed to play blackjack in public.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by the Wynn casino in Las Vegas, which cited Annan’s “poor judgement” in playing blackjack at its premises.</p>
<p>Annan is understood to have lost $500 while playing the game on two separate occasions.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Wynn said: “Mr Annan’s poor judgement has led us to decide that he is no longer welcome on our property.”</p>
<p>The news comes as a setback for the 81-year-old, who has been spending his retirement playing blackjack and other casino games in an effort to win back some of the millions he lost during his time in office.</p>
