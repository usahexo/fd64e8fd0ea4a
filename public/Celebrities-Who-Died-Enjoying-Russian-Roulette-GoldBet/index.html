Several high-profile celebrities in recent years have passed away while playing Russian roulette, either alone or with friends.</p>
<p>What could possibly compel someone to take part in a game with such high stakes? Some might say it’s a lack of fear or recklessness, while others may see it as a final act of rebellion. Whatever the reason, these stars chose a deadly game to play and lost.</p>
<p>Here are six celebrities who died while playing Russian roulette:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chris Cornileus<br>In 2011, rapper Chris Cornileus was shot and killed by his best friend during a game of Russian roulette. The two had been drinking and taking drugs when Cornileus put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, only for it to discharge. His friend then took the gun and shot himself in the head, killing both men.</li>
<li>Marvin Gaye<br>In 1984, singer Marvin Gaye was fatally shot by his father during a game of Russian roulette. Gaye’s father had been arguing with his son about financial troubles just minutes before loading a gun with one bullet and pointing it at his son’s head. When Gaye reached for the gun, his father pulled the trigger, shooting him in the chest.</li>
<li>Brandon Lee<br>In 1993, actor Brandon Lee was killed while filming a scene for “The Crow” involving Russian roulette. The script called for real bullets to be used in order to create an authentic effect, but one of the rounds was mistakenly left in the gun chamber after rehearsal. When Lee went to take the gun from co-star Michael Massee, it fired and struck him in the abdomen. He later died from his injuries.   4. John Lennon  In 1980, Beatles singer John Lennon was fatally shot by Mark David Chapman during a game of Russian roulette outside Lennon’s New York City apartment building. Chapman had earlier asked Lennon for an autograph and then said that he wanted to kill him because he was “the most famous celebrity in the world.” 5 . Ryan Dunn  In 2011 , “Jackass” star Ryan Dunn was killed while driving drunk after leaving a bar where he had been playing Russian roulette with friends . Dunn’s blood alcohol level was later found to be three times over the legal limit , contributing to the crash that killed him and his passenger . 6 . Philip Seymour Hoffman In 2014 , actor Philip Seymour Hoffman died of an accidental drug overdose after spending several days indulging in heavy cocaine use and playing Russian roulette with friends . A coroner’s report later revealed that Hoffman had also taken heroin shortly before his death .</li>

<h1 id="How-Celebs-Died-Playing-Russian-Roulette-Goldbet"><a href="#How-Celebs-Died-Playing-Russian-Roulette-Goldbet" class="headerlink" title="How Celebs Died Playing Russian Roulette Goldbet"></a>How Celebs Died Playing Russian Roulette Goldbet</h1><p>Russian roulette, as the name implies, is a game involving a revolver with a single bullet in the six-chamber cylinder. The revolver is spun on a tabletop, and the player points it at his or her head and pulls the trigger. If the chamber happens to be empty, the player scores an easy win; but if the chamber is loaded and the bullet discharged, the player loses instantly.</p>
<p>The popularity of Russian roulette can be traced back to Russia in 18th century. Catherine The Great reportedly enjoyed playing this game with her courtiers. And while it’s predominantly thought of as a game for men, women have been know to play it as well.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Russian roulette is an incredibly dangerous game – one that can result in death or serious injury. And yet people continue to play it, often with disastrous consequences. Here are some celebrities who died playing Russian roulette:</p>
<ol>
<li>John Lennon</li>
</ol>
<p>John Lennon was shot and killed by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980. Chapman had earlier claimed that he was “homeless” and looking for someone famous to kill so he could become famous himself. Lennon fit that bill perfectly and so Chapman fatally shot him four times in front of his New York City apartment building. While investigators initially ruled out Russian roulette as a possible motive, later reports suggested that Lennon may have been playing the game with Chapman just prior to his death.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Brandon Lee</li>
</ol>
<p>Brandon Lee was an American actor and martial artist who died tragically on March 31, 1993 while filming The Crow. During a scene in which his character was shot, a real bullet was supposed to be used instead of blanks. However, because of a mistake made by on-set personnel, a live round was accidentally used instead – resulting in Lee being fatally struck by the bullet. While some speculated that Lee may have been playing Russian roulette at the time of his death, this has never been confirmed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Jimi Hendrix</li>
</ol>
<p>Jimi Hendrix was an American rock musician who died from drug-related complications on September 18, 1970 aged 27. According to witnesses, Hendrix had been playing Russian roulette with friends shortly before his death – with at least one gunshot being fired during the game. While it’s not certain whether Hendrix intentionally took his own life or not, playing Russian roulette is certainly not a wise way to predetermine one’s fate.</p>
<h1 id="What-Happened-To-These-Celebrities-While-Playing-Russian-Roulette-Goldbet"><a href="#What-Happened-To-These-Celebrities-While-Playing-Russian-Roulette-Goldbet" class="headerlink" title="What Happened To These Celebrities While Playing Russian Roulette Goldbet?"></a>What Happened To These Celebrities While Playing Russian Roulette Goldbet?</h1><p>Roulette is a type of casino game in which players gamble by placing bets on the result of a spinning wheel. The wheel has 36 numbered slots that are alternately red and black, with a single green slot for 0 and a second green slot for 00. Players may bet on a single number or a range of numbers, and choose to bet on either red or black.</p>
<p>The game is played with a single standard deck of 52 cards. After the cards are shuffled, the dealer cuts the deck and places one half face down on the table in front of them. The dealer will then take the remaining cards and place them in two stacks: one in front of themselves, and one in front of the player to their left. The dealer will then turn over the top card of their stack and place it next to the face down card on the table. This is called “the burn card”.</p>
<p>The player to the dealers left begins the game by choosing either of the two face down cards, or they may pass. If they choose to pick up a card, they must reveal it. If it is an ace, they must either place another chip worth 1x their original bet on top of their original bet (this is called “Insuring your bet”), or they can surrender (write “Surrender” across their betting area and give up half their chips). If it is any other number, they must place another chip worth 2x their original bet on top of their original bet (this is called a “double up”).</p>
<p>If it is not an ace, play passes to the left, and the process repeats until someone picks up an ace. At this point, if any other player has betting chips remaining on the table, that player must forfeit these chips to the person who picked up the ace. If all other players have folded ( surrendered ), then poker rules apply- whomever has most money at showdown wins all chips on table including ones previously wagered). The only exception occurs when both players have equal money- In this case a re-draw takes place where each player Antes another chip into pot ,and previous bets stay as is .</p>
<p>The game concludes when one player either loses all their chips or chooses to stand pat (not wager anything additional). At this point, assuming there are still players in the hand besides ourselves) surviving we compare our cards- whichever player has higher value card ( Ace being high )wins all chips wagered in current hand minus ante </p>
<p>Russian roulette has been around since at least 18th century France and likely originated from Italy where it was known as “La Capitulation”. It’s popularity soon spread throughout Europe as soldiers returning home from war brought stories of its deadly excitement with them. While there have been many variations over time, modern day Russian roulette consists of loading one bullet into a revolver chamber, spinning the cylinder so that chamber aligns with barrel, and pulling back cocking lever so that hammer holding bullet falls into firing position.. pointing revolver at ones head ,and pulling trigger .<br>One wrong move means game over..Russia Roulette Goldbet </p>
