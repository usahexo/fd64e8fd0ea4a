      		<h1 id="Kofi-Annan’s-Last-Day-as-Secretary-General"><a href="#Kofi-Annan’s-Last-Day-as-Secretary-General" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan’s Last Day as Secretary-General"></a>Kofi Annan’s Last Day as Secretary-General</h1><p>Kofi Annan’s last day as Secretary-General was September 1, 2006. He had held the position for two terms, the first from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2001, and the second from January 1, 2002 to September 1, 2006.</p>
<p>On his last day in office, Annan delivered a farewell speech to the United Nations General Assembly. In it, he reflected on his time as Secretary-General and offered some advice for his successor. He said: </p>
<p>“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and peace. Let us be ever mindful of the lessons of history and our responsibility to future generations.”</p>
<p>Annan also praised the work of the UN during his tenure, saying: </p>
<p>“In these seven years we have together accomplished much… We have helped to restore confidence in global markets and steered the world economy back from the brink of recession. We have taken important steps to fight AIDS, malaria and other diseases. We have defended human rights and improved maternal health. We have worked together to prevent conflict and build peace.”</p>
<p>He thanked member states for their support and concluded by saying: </p>
<p>“I am deeply grateful to you all for giving me this opportunity to serve humanity. It has been a great honor - and my deepest privilege - to lead this wonderful organization.”</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan’s-Legacy"><a href="#Kofi-Annan’s-Legacy" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan’s Legacy"></a>Kofi Annan’s Legacy</h1><p>Kofi Annan’s death on Saturday, 18th of August, 2018, at the age of 80, after a short illness, has left the world in mourning. Mr. Annan was a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. He was the first from sub-Saharan Africa to hold the position.</p>
<p>In 2001, Mr. Annan and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts “to revive global trust in the organization.” As Secretary-General, Mr. Annan reformed and modernized the UN bureaucracy; he strengthened peacekeeping operations and emphasized preventive diplomacy. He played a decisive role in ending the genocide in Rwanda and restoring peace to Kosovo. He also mediated conflicts in Haiti, Israel-Palestine, and Sudan.</p>
<p>After leaving office, Mr. Annan founded The Kofi Annan Foundation, an international organization that works to promote sustainable development, human rights, democracy, good governance, and conflict resolution. In his lifetime, Mr. Annan received numerous awards and accolades for his leadership and service to humanity, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2007) and honorary British knighthood (2013).</p>
<p>Kofi Annan was a man of great principle who believed in the dignity and worth of every human being. He was also a pragmatist who understood that difficult problems require creative solutions. He will be remembered as one of the most effective Secretaries-General the United Nations has ever had and as a champion for global justice and peace.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-A-Man-of-Peace"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-A-Man-of-Peace" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan: A Man of Peace"></a>Kofi Annan: A Man of Peace</h1><p>Kofi Annan was born on April 8, 1938, in the town of Kumasi, Ghana. He was the son of an Ashanti chief and his mother was a Swedish-born nurse. The family moved to Geneva when Kofi was five years old, and he would later attend college in that city.</p>
<p>After college, Annan joined the United Nations (UN) in 1962 as a junior official. In 1974, he became the UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. Two years later, he became its youngest-ever head when he was appointed Deputy Secretary-General.</p>
<p>In 1997, Annan was appointed UN Secretary-General by the organization’s member countries. As the head of the UN, Annan was often called on to mediate or investigate some of the world’s most difficult conflicts. His efforts were often praised, although he also faced criticism at times.</p>
<p>Annan stepped down as Secretary-General in 2007. He then founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, which works to promote peace and sustainable development around the world.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Kofi Annan was recognized for his tireless work in support of peace and human rights. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan passed away on August 18, 2018, at the age of 80. He will be remembered as a man who worked tirelessly to make the world a better place for all people.</p>
<h1 id="Remembering-Kofi-Annan"><a href="#Remembering-Kofi-Annan" class="headerlink" title="Remembering Kofi Annan"></a>Remembering Kofi Annan</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, has passed away at the age of 80. He was an important figure in international diplomacy and will be remembered for his efforts to promote peace and human rights.</p>
<p>Born in Ghana in 1938, Annan rose to prominence as the head of UN peacekeeping operations during the Rwandan genocide. In 2001, he was appointed UN Secretary-General, becoming the first African to hold the position.</p>
<p>As Secretary-General, Annan worked to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world. He was a vocal advocate for action against climate change, and campaigned for reform within the UN. He also played a pivotal role in the Iraq War and the Syrian Civil War.</p>
<p>Annan’s work earned him numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001. After stepping down as Secretary-General in 2006, he continued to work on humanitarian issues through his foundation.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan was a respected diplomat and humanitarian who made a significant impact on global affairs. He will be remembered as a visionary leader who worked tirelessly to promote peace and human rights.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-The-United-Nations’-Greatest-Secretary-General"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-The-United-Nations’-Greatest-Secretary-General" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan: The United Nations’ Greatest Secretary-General"></a>Kofi Annan: The United Nations’ Greatest Secretary-General</h1><p>Kofi Annan was the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, serving from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006. He was the first UN employee to be appointed to the role from outside the organization.</p>
<p>Annan was born in Ghana on April 8, 1938. He completed his undergraduate studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1961. After working for the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Annan joined the UN Secretariat in Geneva in 1962. He held a variety of positions there before becoming Deputy Director of Human Resources Development in 1974.</p>
<p>In 1981, Annan was appointed Assistant Secretary-General for Program Planning and Budget; he subsequently served as Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management from March 1992 to December 1996. As Secretary-General, Annan reformed and streamlined the UN bureaucracy; he also championed UN reform efforts, including the creation of two new peacekeeping missions in East Timor and Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2001 – less than a month after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., – Annan issued a statement calling for “a world where human rights are at the core of every decision we make.” The following year, he launched The Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve eight goals – including halving extreme poverty and halting the spread of HIV&#x2F;AIDS – by 2015. All but one of these goals were eventually met or exceeded.</p>
<p>Annan also played a key role in shaping the United Nations response to climate change. In 2005, he helped broker the landmark Paris Agreement – which called for concerted global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and later served as co-chair of its High Level Panel on Climate Change Financing.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan passed away on August 18, 2018, at age 80. In recognition of his many contributions to peace and human rights around the world, he was awarded numerous medals and accolades during his lifetime, including the Nobel Peace Prize (2001). “Kofi Annan was a global statesman who brought enormous dedication and passion to his work for peace and human rights,” said current UN Secretary-General António Guterres following Annan’s death. “He made an indelible mark on the United Nations and our world.”</p>
