      		<h1 id="Falcons-looking-to-start-off-season-with-a-win-against-Carolina-Panthers"><a href="#Falcons-looking-to-start-off-season-with-a-win-against-Carolina-Panthers" class="headerlink" title="Falcons looking to start off season with a win against Carolina Panthers"></a>Falcons looking to start off season with a win against Carolina Panthers</h1><p>The Falcons are set to take on the Panthers in Charlotte on September 16th in what is sure to be an exciting game. This matchup will feature two of the best quarterbacks in the league, Matt Ryan and Cam Newton.</p>
<p>The Falcons had a disappointing season last year, finishing 7-9 and missing the playoffs. However, they have made some key additions this offseason and are looking to start off this season with a win against the Panthers. Some of those additions include defensive endBruce Irvin, wide receiver Calvin Ridley, and cornerback Isaiah Oliver.</p>
<p>The Panthers finished 11-5 last year and made it to the playoffs before losing in the Wild Card round. Cam Newton had an MVP-caliber season last year, and they will look to him once again to lead them to victory.</p>
<p>This game should be a close one, with both teams having a lot of talent. The Falcons have revenge on their mind after losing to the Panthers twice last year, and they will be looking to start off this season with a win.</p>
<h1 id="Cam-Newton-and-the-Carolina-Panthers-looking-to-upset-the-Atlanta-Falcons"><a href="#Cam-Newton-and-the-Carolina-Panthers-looking-to-upset-the-Atlanta-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers looking to upset the Atlanta Falcons"></a>Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers looking to upset the Atlanta Falcons</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers are coming into this game as the underdogs against the Atlanta Falcons. However, they have a lot to prove after a disappointing season last year. Cam Newton is looking to make a comeback this season and prove that he is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league. The Panthers have also made some big changes in their lineup, including signing cornerback James Bradberry to a five-year contract extension. The Falcons are coming into this game as the favorites, but the Panthers definitely have what it takes to upset them.</p>
<p>The Falcons had a great season last year, finishing with an 11-5 record and making it all the way to the Super Bowl. However, they lost to the New England Patriots and now they are looking to take revenge this season. They have made some big changes in their lineup this year, including signing running back Devonta Freeman to a five-year contract extension. Julio Jones is also looking to have another great season after finishing with 1,409 yards and six touchdowns last year.</p>
<p>The Panthers had a tough season last year, finishing with a 6-10 record. However, they made some big changes in their lineup this year and are looking to improve on that record. Cam Newton is looking to have a comeback season after struggling last year, and he has plenty of targets to throw to including Devin Funchess and Curtis Samuel. The Panthers’ defense is also looking strong this year after signing cornerback James Bradberry to a five-year contract extension.</p>
<p>This is going to be an exciting game to watch and it’s definitely going to be close. The Panthers have what it takes to upset the Falcons, but it’s going to take a lot of hard work and determination.</p>
<h1 id="Julio-Jones-looking-to-tear-up-the-Carolina-Panthers-defense"><a href="#Julio-Jones-looking-to-tear-up-the-Carolina-Panthers-defense" class="headerlink" title="Julio Jones looking to tear up the Carolina Panthers defense"></a>Julio Jones looking to tear up the Carolina Panthers defense</h1><p>The Atlanta Falcons come into this Week Six matchup against the Carolina Panthers with a 4-1 record and Julio Jones is a big reason why.</p>
<p>Jones has already racked up 430 yards and four touchdowns on the season. In Week Five against the Miami Dolphins, Julio caught nine passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Jones will likely be matched up against Panthers cornerback James Bradberry for most of the game. Bradberry is in his second year in the league and is coming off a good performance against the New England Patriots. He had six tackles and one pass defended in that game.</p>
<p>However, Jones should still be able to get open often against Bradberry. The cornerback does not have great speed and will have trouble keeping up with Julio in coverage.</p>
<p>The Panthers’ defense overall has been struggling this year, giving up an average of over 28 points per game. They are especially vulnerable to opposing wide receivers, so Julio Jones could have a huge game on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Devonta-Freeman-expected-to-have-a-huge-game-against-Panthers"><a href="#Devonta-Freeman-expected-to-have-a-huge-game-against-Panthers" class="headerlink" title="Devonta Freeman expected to have a huge game against Panthers"></a>Devonta Freeman expected to have a huge game against Panthers</h1><p>Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman is expected to have a huge game against the Carolina Panthers according to many NFL experts.</p>
<p>Freeman is coming off a huge performance against the Green Bay Packers in which he rushed for over 100 yards and scored two touchdowns. He is now averaging over 100 yards from scrimmage and has scored six touchdowns in his last four games.</p>
<p>The Panthers have had problems stopping the run this season, allowing over 120 rushing yards per game. Freeman should be able to take advantage of this weakness and have a big game on Sunday.</p>
<p>If the Falcons are able to win on Sunday, they will move into first place in the NFC South. Freeman will be a big reason why they are successful, so make sure you keep an eye on him during the game.</p>
<h1 id="Matt-Ryan-and-the-Atlanta-Falcons-hoping-for-a-victory-in-Week-1"><a href="#Matt-Ryan-and-the-Atlanta-Falcons-hoping-for-a-victory-in-Week-1" class="headerlink" title="Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons hoping for a victory in Week 1"></a>Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons hoping for a victory in Week 1</h1><p>The Atlanta Falcons will start their 2017 season on the road against the Chicago Bears. The Falcons are coming off a disappointing loss to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. Quarterback Matt Ryan is looking to rebound from a poor performance in that game. The Falcons defense will need to be better this season if they want to make it back to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Bears have a new head coach in John Fox and a new quarterback in Mike Glennon. The Bears are hoping that Glennon can be the answer at quarterback after years of struggles at that position. The Bears have some talented players on defense, but they lack depth at key positions.</p>
<p>The Falcons are favored to win this game, but it won’t be easy. If the Falcons can’t get their offense going, they could find themselves losing this game.</p>
