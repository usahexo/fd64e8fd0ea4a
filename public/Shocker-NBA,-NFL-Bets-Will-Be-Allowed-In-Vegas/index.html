                <h1>Shocker NBA, NFL Bets Will Be Allowed In Vegas</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Shocker-NBA-NFL-Bets-Will-Be-Allowed-In-Vegas"><a href="#Shocker-NBA-NFL-Bets-Will-Be-Allowed-In-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Shocker: NBA, NFL Bets Will Be Allowed In Vegas"></a>Shocker: NBA, NFL Bets Will Be Allowed In Vegas</h1><p>The NBA Board of Governors on Wednesday voted in favor of allowing sports betting on its games, a move that is expected to eventually lead to legalized gambling across the United States. The vote was 29-1 in favor of the change with the Dallas Mavericks’ owner Mark Cuban being the lone dissenter.</p>
<p>This news comes hot on the heels of the NFL seemingly giving up its long-standing opposition to sports betting. In a May meeting, team representatives voted 31-1 in favor of amending their anti-gambling policy to allow league partnerships with casinos and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean for gambling fans?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it means that you will be able to place bets on NBA and NFL games at legal US casinos and sportsbooks. This includes well-known brands such as MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, and Wynn Resorts. It’s also likely that new casinos will crop up specifically catering to sports bettors.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s expected that there will be a flurry of activity surrounding in-game betting. This is where gamblers can place wagers on events as they are taking place (e.g., who will score next, whether there will be a safety). Pinnacle Sports has already announced that it plans to offer in-game betting for NBA games starting Thursday night.</p>
<p>There is also speculation that this move could lead to increased viewership for both the NBA and NFL. With more people having a financial interest in the outcome of games, there could be a greater desire to watch them. Of course, this has yet to be proven but it’s an interesting theory nonetheless.</p>
<p>At long last, US gambling fans are getting some good news after years of being dealt nothing but bad hands. Not only can they now legally bet on NBA and NFL games, but there is also growing speculation that other major sports leagues will follow suit. So keep your eyes peeled for future announcements on this matter!</p>
<h1 id="Slots-vs-Sports-The-Battle-for-Vegas-Gambling-Dollars"><a href="#Slots-vs-Sports-The-Battle-for-Vegas-Gambling-Dollars" class="headerlink" title="Slots vs. Sports: The Battle for Vegas Gambling Dollars"></a>Slots vs. Sports: The Battle for Vegas Gambling Dollars</h1><p>In the early days of Las Vegas, there were only two types of gambling available: slots and sports betting. And for a long time, that was all anyone wanted. But in recent years, a new challenger has emerged to try to take some of those gambling dollars away from the casinos: casino table games.</p>
<p>The battle for Las Vegas gambling dollars is heating up, and it’s now more important than ever for casinos to offer a variety of games to attract players. Let’s take a look at how the different types of gambling stack up against each other.</p>
<p>Slots</p>
<p>Slot machines are still by far the most popular type of gambling in Las Vegas. They’re easy to play, there’s no skill involved, and you can win big payouts if you hit the right combination. And with so many different types of slot machines available, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p>Sports Betting</p>
<p>Sports betting is another popular option in Las Vegas. It’s simple enough – just pick the team or player you think will win – and there are plenty of betting options available, from individual games to season-long bets. Sports betting can be lucrative if you know what you’re doing, but it can also be pretty risky.</p>
<p>Casino Table Games</p>
<p>Casino table games are becoming increasingly popular in Las Vegas, as players are looking for more excitement and challenge than they can find with slots or sports betting. There are many different types of casino table games available, from blackjack to poker to roulette, and each has its own set of rules and strategies. If you’re looking for a more challenging gaming experience, casino table games are definitely worth trying out.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Sports-Betting-Bring-More-Gamblers-to-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Will-Sports-Betting-Bring-More-Gamblers-to-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Will Sports Betting Bring More Gamblers to Las Vegas?"></a>Will Sports Betting Bring More Gamblers to Las Vegas?</h1><p>The debate about whether legalized sports betting will bring more gamblers to Las Vegas is a hot topic. The earliest mention of gambling in Las Vegas was in 1905 when a group of men rented a hotel room and established a makeshift casino. However, it was not until 1931 when gambling was legalized in Nevada. Gambling has been a mainstay in Las Vegas since that time.</p>
<p>Now there is a renewed interest in sports betting with many states legalizing it. The question is, will this bring more people to Las Vegas? There are those who believe that it will and those who believe that it will not.</p>
<p>Las Vegas has been the gambling capital of the world for many years. There are numerous casinos and other gambling establishments in the city. In addition, there are several shows and attractions that draw people to Las Vegas. While it is possible that legalized sports betting may bring some additional people to Las Vegas, it is not likely to have a significant impact on the tourism industry in the city.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting may have a different impact on other cities in Nevada. For example, Reno may see an increase in tourism as people visit the city to place bets on sporting events. However, this is unlikely to have any impact on Las Vegas itself.</p>
<h1 id="Ready-For-Some-Football-How-About-A-Wager"><a href="#Ready-For-Some-Football-How-About-A-Wager" class="headerlink" title="Ready For Some Football? How About A Wager?"></a>Ready For Some Football? How About A Wager?</h1><p>The NFL preseason is underway, which means it’s time to start thinking about your fantasy football league. And if you’re like many people, you may be looking for ways to make the season more interesting.</p>
<p>One way to do that is by betting on the games. You can make straight bets on the outcome of a game, or you can bet on different aspects of the game, such as the total points scored or the margin of victory.</p>
<p>Another option is to create a fantasy football league with a gambling twist. This can add an extra level of excitement and competition to the season.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to set up a gambling-themed fantasy football league. One option is to have each team in the league bet on individual games each week. So for example, Team A might bet $10 on Team B winning by more than 10 points, while Team B might bet $5 on Team A winning by fewer than 7 points.</p>
<p>Another option is to have each team put down a fixed amount at the beginning of the season. The team that has the most money at the end of the season wins. This can add an extra level of excitement if teams are close in terms of their overall standings.</p>
<p>A third option is to use a points system instead of money. In this case, teams earn points for various things, such as winning or losing, scoring touchdowns or field goals, and so on. The team with the most points at the end of the season wins. This type of system can be more complicated, but it can also be more fun since it allows for more strategic play.</p>
<p>No matter how you choose to set up your gambling-themed fantasy football league, it’s sure to add some extra excitement to the season. So get ready for some fun!</p>
<h1 id="Bookies-in-Sin-City-Expect-Big-Business-from-New-Orleans-Saints"><a href="#Bookies-in-Sin-City-Expect-Big-Business-from-New-Orleans-Saints" class="headerlink" title="Bookies in Sin City Expect Big Business from New Orleans Saints"></a>Bookies in Sin City Expect Big Business from New Orleans Saints</h1><p>Las Vegas bookmakers are expecting a flood of bets on the New Orleans Saints in the coming days as the team advances to the NFC Championship game. On Saturday, the Saints knocked off the heavily favored Los Angeles Rams with a dramatic overtime victory.</p>
<p>Now they’re set to take on the Minnesota Vikings, who are considered underdogs even though they have home-field advantage. Oddsmakers say that may be because of how well Drew Brees and the Saints offense have been playing lately.</p>
<p>“The odds are definitely favoring New Orleans in this matchup,” one Las Vegas sportsbook manager told reporters. “But we’re still seeing some people put money on Minnesota, especially since they’re playing at home.”</p>
<p>According to reports, some bookies are already gearing up for a busy week as football fans place their bets leading up to Sunday’s game. In fact, early estimates suggest that over $10 million could be wagered on the match-up in Las Vegas alone.</p>
<p>That number is expected to grow even larger if the Saints manage to pull off another upset victory and advance to the Super Bowl. In anticipation of that possibility, some bookmakers have begun increasing their betting lines on New Orleans, making them even more favorable for potential bettors.</p>
<p>So far this NFL season, Sin City has raked in over $158 million in sports betting revenue – a new record. And it looks like that number is only going to go up as we get closer to the Super Bowl. If you want to get in on all the action, be sure to visit your nearest Las Vegas sportsbook and place your bets!</p>
